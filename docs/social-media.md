🎲 🆕 Project: Stochastic iALM for Household Financial Planning 🏡📈

See [stochastic-ialm] — a Python implementation of INDIVIDUAL ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT iALM using DYNAMIC STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING (DSP).

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

Traditional financial planning asks "How do I maximize my pot of money?" This model asks the better question: "Can I sustainably meet my life goals across thousands of possible futures?"

**WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT:**

❌ No "assume 7% returns forever"
✅ Simulates realistic market dynamics (GBM for equities, mean-reverting inflation)

❌ No single risk number
✅ Distinguishes fixed liabilities (mortgages) from inflation-indexed ones (school fees, living costs)

❌ No static allocation rules
✅ Uses behavioral finance (Prospect Theory) to prioritize Minimum → Acceptable → Desirable goals

**WHAT'S INCLUDED:**

📊 STOCHASTIC ENGINES for equity & inflation paths
💰 LIABILITY PROJECTION FRAMEWORK with inflation indexing
📈 "Reality Check" wealth EVOLUTION SIMULATOR
📓 3 NOTEBOOKS walking through the model
🧪 Unit tests & DOCUMENTATION

Built on the Dempster & Medova (2010) framework, adapted for modern Python tooling.
